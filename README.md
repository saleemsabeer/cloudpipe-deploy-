# cloudpipe-deploy-

## 🚀 Project Overview

CloudPipe is a small web development company that creates websites for local businesses. Their current workflow involves manually uploading files to production servers, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient.

This project aims to implement a simple and effective CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions** and **AWS S3** to automate deployments. The goal is to modernize CloudPipe's workflow and make deployments faster, more reliable, and less stressful.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

CloudPipe’s developers currently face:

- **Manual deployment overhead**: Developers must download the latest files from GitHub and manually upload them to production.
- **Frequent deployment errors**: Critical files (e.g., JavaScript updates) are sometimes forgotten, causing site features to break.
- **Wasted developer time**: Simple content changes take up to 20 minutes to deploy.

---

## ✅ Solution Goals

To resolve these challenges, CloudPipe needs a basic CI/CD solution that:

- Automates deployments upon code pushes to GitHub
- Provides visibility into deployment success/failure
- Sends basic error notifications
- Uses AWS S3 for static site hosting

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **GitHub Actions** – For CI/CD automation
- **AWS S3** – For static website hosting
- **GitHub** – Source control and code hosting

---

## 🛠️ Key Features

- 🚀 **Automated Deployment**: Push code to GitHub and it goes live automatically.
- 📣 **Deployment Feedback**: Developers are notified if a deployment fails.
- 📝 **Deployment Logs**: Basic logs for debugging and auditability.
- 🔒 **Reliable Process**: Eliminates the risk of forgotten or missed files.

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when:

- Code pushes trigger automated deployments to the production S3 bucket
- Deployment failures are immediately visible to developers
- Website updates are consistent and reflect changes accurately
- The deployment process is significantly faster than the previous manual approach

---

## 📦 Outcome

This foundational CI/CD pipeline allows CloudPipe to:

- Focus on development instead of deployment logistics
- Reduce downtime due to human error
- Deliver changes to production quickly and confidently
